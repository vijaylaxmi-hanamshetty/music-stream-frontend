# Music Stream Frontend

This is the **frontend** of a music streaming application, built with **Next.js** and modern React.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the frontend locally:

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:vijaylaxmi-hanamshetty/music-stream-frontend.git
cd music-stream-frontend

npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev

##  project structurw#

This version is **lightweight**, perfect for when you are **only setting up the frontend** and haven’t connected it to backend yet.  

If you want, I can also make a **slightly more colorful README with badges** for Node, Next.js, and GitHub stars — it will look professional right away on GitHub. Do you want me to do that?
